Hi! I am a PhD candidate at [AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/) supervised by Max Welling, Jan-Willem van de Meent and Alfons Hoekstra. I am trying to learn PDEs from data using deep learning. Before joining the University of Amsterdam, I was a research assistant at Helmholtz AI, where I worked on applications of machine learning for material science. I also spent some time working on graph neural networks and generative modelling with applications in neuroscience. Long ago, I developed statistical models of clinical treatment at TU Dresden.

Overall, my research interests revolve around `physics-inspired deep learning` and `geometric deep learning`. I am also interested in AI4Science and the applications of machine learning to physics.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing basketball and testing gravity when skateboarding.
