Our paper "Implicit Convolutional Kernels for Steerable CNNs" has been accepted to NeurIPS 2023! We developed a simple and efficient way to parameterize group equivariant convolutional kernels using implicit neural representation, which greatly simplifies the design of steerable CNNs. Check out the [blog post](../blog/implicit_kernels.html) for details.
