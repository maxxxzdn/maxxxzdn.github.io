Together with David Ruhe, Maurice Weiler and others, we have developed `Clifford-Steerable CNNs` - a new class of isometry-equivariant CNNs that are able to operate on pseudo-Euclidean spaces, such as Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. Really strong results on PDEs, new relativistic benchmark and lots of very cool math. The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14730).
