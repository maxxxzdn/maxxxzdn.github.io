[ðŸš¨ Workshop paper] We introduce [Conditional Clifford-Steerable convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14007), where we condition the convolutional operator with auxiliary information, achieving highly expressive, equivariant, and efficient framework which we apply to PDE modelling. Accepted to AI4Science Workshop at NeurIPS 2025.
